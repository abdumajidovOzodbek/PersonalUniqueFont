App Idea: “OpenChess” – Online Chess Platform (React + Node.js)
🎯 Goal:
Build a full-stack online chess game that functions similarly to Chess.com, allowing players to log in, play real-time matches, track their stats, and chat — all in a simplified MVP format suitable for a junior developer.

🔑 Key Features
✅ 1. User System (Authentication)
Signup/login via email and password

JWT-based authentication (Node.js backend)

User profile: username, rating (ELO), avatar

🧠 2. Chess Gameplay
Interactive chessboard (React) with drag-and-drop or click-to-move

Legal move validation using chess.js

Game rules enforced: check/checkmate/stalemate

Timer options (5|10|30 min) using countdown clocks

🧩 3. Real-Time Multiplayer
Use Socket.IO to handle real-time games

Matchmaking system: “Find Random Opponent” or “Invite via Code”

Moves are synced live between two clients

💬 4. In-Game Chat
Chat box for players during matches

Typing indicators and emojis

📜 5. Game History
Save games to DB (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)

Users can view previous games and replay moves step-by-step

Store move logs (PGN or array of FEN strings)

🧑‍💼 6. User Dashboard
List of recent games

Stats: wins/losses/draws, average time per move

Option to rematch opponents
